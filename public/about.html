<p>A little bit about me. Firstly I am a son to the 
  most high Living God, Jesus Christ my Saviour, then I am 
  a husband to a beautiful Godly wife, and then I am a 
  father to three beautiful children, who have a strong 
  calling on their lives.
</p>

<p>So a little about me, I am a South African born 
  Portuguese, with 20 years experiance in the aviation
  industry and over 14 years experiance in the Learning 
  & Development world within the aviation industry.
</p>

<p>I am now looking for a change and dont want to be working
  for a company, no matter how big or small, but rather want 
  to work for myself and have more time with my family.
</p>

<P>I have travelled to many countries from Australia, to Hong Kong
  to Turkey (twice), to Spain and Portugal and have actually
  lived in the United States of America. I have visited roughly
  12 states and lived in the 13th one.
