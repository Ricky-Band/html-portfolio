 <h1>The best Movie Saga's according to Ricardo</h1>
 <h2>The top 4 Movie Saga's of all-time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Fast and the Furious 1 to 9</h3>

<p>It all started in the 90's with Toretto and Brian of a simple movie about street racers
and a cop tryingto break a hijacking ring that involved Toretto, it all led to what is now
in my opinion one of the best on going movie sagas that you will ever find, even with the 
passing of Brian in real life.</p>
 
 <h3>Star Wars</h3>
 
<p>Now I havenot watched all of them or the spin offs, but this is a classic that I started 
watching in the 80's with friends and still has some of the widely used phrases such as;
Luke, I am your Father and the Force is strong in this one, and then the ones always used
in the month of May; May the 4th be with you and revenge of the 5th (for the day after.)</p>
 
 <h3>Marvel Universe</h3>
 
<p>So this one is not all about it being the same movie but more about seperate hero movies 
that can be watched in a specific order to make one coherant story line, the better thing 
about this is you can one hero's movies like Ironman together and all three follow a 
storyline, same with Thor, etc.</p>
 
 <h3>DC Universe</h3>
 
<p>Now this one is not to be left off of anylist and this is due to DC having a diffrent spin
on things and including villians and making them look like heros, however each movie does
not seem to follow on storyline like Marvel, but this universe is not a well mature and 
near its end like Marvel is and this may change with further movie releases. One thing to 
note is that it does go dark very quickly and even Black Adam can be construde as evil
and showing satan.</p>
